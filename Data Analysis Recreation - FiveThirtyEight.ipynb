These encodings are taken from the original dataset, in which 0 encompasses white, Hispanic (white), Middle Eastern (white), some multiracial subjects depending on background and Hispanic (Latin American).

    "This indicates that just 21 of the biopics in the dataset are about a woman of colour, which is the same as was found by the article - even with the increased race data in the updated dataset. The article then indicates that three of the films are about Cleopatra (Caesar and Cleopatra, Cleopatra, and Cleopatra), and in all three of those films Cleopatra is played by a white woman. This is surprisingly common - the race of the actor or actress is not in the dataset so without excessive research it is difficult to find, but a known example even within the short list of films about women of colour is 'A Mighty Heart', in which Mariane Pearl, a multiracial woman of majorly Cuban descent, is played by Angelina Jolie.\n",

The majority of biopics about women are about those classified as \"Other\" - many are noblewomen or activists who are also well known for another major category.\n",
