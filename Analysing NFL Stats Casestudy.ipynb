    "\n",
    "This casestudy covers an analysis of NFL statistics from the 2021 season, containing statistics for 32 teams. It covers:\n",
    "* Data visualisation for game statistics\n",
    "* Modelling statistics to predict winning teams\n",
    "* Tuning the model to improve its accuracy\n",
    "* Determining which statistics were most influential\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "The dataset we’re working with comprises NFL game stats during the 2021 NFL season. They contain offensive and defensive stats for each game played by each team (including postseason games where applicable) as well as game details such as which teams are competing, the date of the matchup, and the outcome of the game. This dataset was cleaned and modified by Codecademy to include only the stats we needed for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the dataset is not loaded into this environment, so running the code a second time will throw an error - however it is currently in its correctly run state."
